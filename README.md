# AUTOFILE_ORGANIZATION-PROJECT

Here I explain about autofile organization project. These project is use for transfer file automatically. When you run this code first you get gui for user input.
In gui you first give a path for source and destination folder,You can't copy path and paste there because it is read only.
When you click on submit button first recognise what is the extension of file then create a folder name of extension type and move the file of that same extension type in that folder respectively.
If you don't give any path then it will give you error. 
If same file is already in destination folder than it will give you a  error and  display message that "File is already exit!!". 
So when you click on submit button files will be automatically sorted in destination folder and source folder will be empty.
